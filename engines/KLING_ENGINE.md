## Prompt Formula
Subject + Action + Environment + Camera Movement + Lighting + Style + Mood + Motion Constraints + Negative Constraints

## Motion Vocabulary
- Controlled walk cycle
- Wind-blown fabric
- Hair movement
- Slow turn
- Eye blink
- Subtle expression shift
- Object floating
- Water ripple
- Light sweep
- Dynamic tracking
- Cinematic dolly

## Base Prompt
Animate this reference image into a cinematic video while preserving the character identity, clothing, facial structure, composition, and color palette. Add controlled natural motion, smooth camera movement, realistic lighting change, and stable scene continuity. Avoid face drift, distorted hands, extra limbs, flicker, warping, text artifacts, and sudden style changes.

## Best Use Cases
- When character identity matters
- When stronger motion is needed than Hailuo
- When creating short emotional or action loops
- When testing cinematic scene movement

## Default Rules
- Protect face and hands first.
- Keep motion readable.
- Do not over-animate static portraits.
- Use clear camera verbs.
- Add negative constraints every time.
